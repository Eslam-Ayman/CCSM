### Lessons Learnt:
* Whilst pair programming you can be in the drivers seat, and still pick up on a lot and learn new skills.  
* Pair programming can also be challenging, trying to make sure everyone has a fair chance to implement their vision.  
* GIT! We made a staging and master branches, as well as feature branches to try and avoid merge conflicts.  
* Time is precious!  
* _Screens can be small... Always Mobile First_ . 
* Learn Grid  

#### _DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF!_

### Issues:
* Mobile Optimization could have been addressed from the beginning instead of retrospectively.
* Accessibility could have been highlighted throughout the project.  
* Avoiding Patch-work code - try to find and fix the problem instead of coding a hotfix.

### Stretch goals;
* Specific error messages for form inputs.  
* Mobile Optimization.
